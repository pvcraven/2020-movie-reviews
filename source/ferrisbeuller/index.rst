Ferris Bueller's Day Off
========================

Plot
----
Ferris Bueller's Day Off is exactly what the title says it will be. This movie follows a popular high school senior, Ferris, and his friends as they attempt to ditch school and have the best day off ever. The movie starts with Ferris getting himself out of school for the day, and then we see him convince his best friend Cam to play hooky as well. Once Cam is in, the boys figure out how to get Ferris's girlfriend Sloane out for the day. While the three friends are out of school, they're not off the hook. Their principal Ed Rooney is out to get them, and Rooney makes it his mission to take the trio down. Ferris's sister is also mad he's cutting class, and she is out to get him caught as well. Ferris and his friends do their best to have the perfect day off without getting caught. 

About
-----
There are many famous actors in the film, including Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Grey, Alan Ruck, and even Charlie Sheen. Although it came out in 1986, this coming of age film will never go out of style with its bold lines and fourth wall breaks. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the most iconic films of all time, and it was directed by none other than John Hughes, which puts it in the category of classic, must-see movies from the 80s. This movie captures audiences and keeps them on the edge of their seats; it seems as though there is trouble for the group around every corner. 

Reviewer's Thoughts
-------------------
I think I watched this movie at the perfect age; I remember I was a junior in high school when I saw it for the first time. Like many others, I fell in love with this movie; everything about it was perfect. There is so much to love about this movie, and you are never bored. My absolute favorite scene is when the trio goes to the art museum, there isn't very much talking going on, but I think that scene is perfect, and it captures the melancholy feeling of hanging out with your high school friends for what might be the last time. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a movie that everyone can agree on, the message is so timeless, and the quality of the movie makes it easy for everyone to watch. 

My favorite scenes in the movie include:

* The art museum.
* Cameron shouting in his car.
* Sloane leaving school.
* The parade.
