   Lady Bird [#f1]_

*“Lady Bird,”* tells a coming-of-age story of a young woman, Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson, as she struggles to make plans for her future. Lady Bird wants to leave her hometown of Sacramento and go to college on the east coast, preferably New York. 

However, conflict starts when Lady Bird’s mother insists her goal is unrealistic as the family can barely afford to even send her to a state school. Throughout the film, Lady Bird continues to butt heads with her mother and eventually driving a wedge between the two when Lady Bird goes behind her mother’s back to have her father complete her financial aid application for east coast schools.

*“Lady Bird”* is shown to struggle with issues of self-image throughout the film. Despite struggling with money, her family is able to send Lady Bird to a costly private school. Due to this, many of Lady Bird’s relationships revolve around money. Lady Bird is very aware of her little money her family has and often is embarrassed by it, creating an imaginary world where she lives in luxury like the rest of her classmates.

Lady Bird is impulsive and often selfish. Despite being the protagonist, Lady Bird is not always a likable character. Lady Bird often undermines what her family does to make sure she lives a good life, always wanting more than what they are giving her, not realizing the great sacrifices they already made for her. 

Overall, *“Lady Bird”* is rich with drama but also has enough laughs to break the tension on occasion when necessary. What is so successful about *“Lady Bird”* is the dynamic between Lady Bird and her mother. The viewer is able to see and understand both the views of Lady Bird as well as her mother as they struggle to agree with each other. 

*“Lady Bird”* is not the perfect protagonist by any means, but she manages to invoke an emotional response in viewers.
